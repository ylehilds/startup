# My Fitness Plan
## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

My fitness plan app is a fitness tracking app that allows users to plan & log their workouts with an easy user experience by allowing users to plan workouts in advance. Add or edit workouts and keep track of them by enabling them to look at a workout chart. Allow users to input weight each month and display a graph to easy see where they are at monthly. 

Have you ever been at a grocery store and by default just buying what you have always bought, potentially/usually junk food? This app will enable users to create healthy meals list, so that when you go to the grocery store you will have a good idea what items you should get. 

A key fitness is to keep users motivated, this app will display motivational quotes with the hope to keep users motivated to stick with their goals. 

In summary the main goal is to enable users to plan and track workout efforts, create healthy recipes meals list as to influence purchase of healthy food and live a healthy lifestyle!
